# WhatToWatch

## What is it and what does it do?

### Description
What to Watch application is a personalized service that will allow users to track upcoming Movies and TV Shows, get recommendations based on their preferences and watchlist history, and create events to schedule watch parties with friends.

### Problem to Solve 
At present, if one wants to track the release date of movies or air date of tv shows, get movie recommendations, and create watch parties to watch TV together with friends, they need to use multiple mobile and/or web applications as there is no option in the market to achieve them in one application. 
Our goal is to minimize the effort of the user and provide them with all the aforementioned services in one location and more.

### Features
-   Users can track upcoming movies/Tv shows and get Notified via email/message. It shows the new episodes that have been released, for the shows that you are currently watching and keeps track of the watched episodes.
-   Provides a watchlist to add/remove a show or a movie. Watchlist is a placeholder from where we can start watching a show
-   Users can see Trending shows and search for Movies/TV based on genre or title.
-   Personalized Recommendation for movies and tv shows based on user preference and watchlist history. Factors like the completed shows, stopped watching shows, added to watchlist, along with the preference data will be considered for giving recommendations using AWS Personalise which uses a hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN).
-   Holds a Social Page where users can follow/unfollow friends and see what they are currently watching.
-   Plan watch parties and invite friends (through joining link). Invitees receive event links through email and can choose to accept or decline from the social page.
